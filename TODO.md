# TODO

- [ ] Create Python virtual environment with required packages to make it easy to set up the proper dev pipeline
	- cmarkgfm
	- beautifulsoup4
- [ ] Create local and remote builds (development v. production, sort of) - I want to make the links relative to path or relative to site
- [ ] Figure out where to put assets like 'highlight.css'
- [ ] Figure out how to manage "static" (non-generated) assets that are currently in the "assets" folder - how are they copied to the "site" output directory (?)
