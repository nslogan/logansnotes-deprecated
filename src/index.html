<h1>Logan's Notes</h1>

<h2>What is this place?</h2>

<p>I have many interests, too many actually. I have a tendency to start a project, get distracted, fall down a hole, and start another project. This means that at any given time I have 100+ tabs open, 5 or 6 Sublime instances, and an even dozen terminal sessions. Some would say I should learn to use my tools more effectively - project quick switching in Sublime, tmux, etc. I say I should learn to take better notes and only have one or two projects open at once.</p>

<p>That's where this site comes in. I like taking notes in Markdown. I'm always in a text editor and it's easy to read pre- and post-generation. However, I've got Markdown documents (saved and unsaved) spread across all of these sessions. Between work and home I've had half a dozen machines in the last few years. I've never settled on a system for storing my files other than Google Drive and external drives.</p>

<p>However, as I was battling through closing out tabs and open projects I realized that I should just finally commit to trying a simple note system. And then I complicated it immediately. Go figure. You see, while I love Markdown there have always been a few drawbacks for me:<p>

<ul>
	<li>Not all of the languages I want are supported in code block highlighting (AVR assembly, objdump output, etc.)</li>
	<li>There's no easy way to insert colored terminal listings - you could put in a screen captures but I'm a fan of text when possible</li>
</ul>

<p>There are more but I'm tired and want to wrap this up into a minimally cohesive thought.</p>

<p>Basically, my plan is to make a site of all of my notes by creating a framework and pipeline that can take a collection of Markdown documents and spit out a site that looks like what I want. It maintains the readability and searchability of plain text documents while creating pretty pages for your consumption. I'm going to host the whole source on GitHub, including the tools I use, and have lots of interesting source control related output on the site (when the page was last updated, link to source, etc.).</p>

<p>The Internet has been pretty helpful in my quest for knowledge, hopefully I can give something small back.</p>
